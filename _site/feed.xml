I am working in a coffee shop, I love it, but there is covid-19 so we were just chilling at home for the past 5 months. I’m a person who loves working, I can’t really understand people to be honest, that is why I love working that won’t change. Sometimes I try to have friends, but I always end up with awkward situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone knows you, and you might have depression and just got bad news. You might end up drinking in a bar, just to get over it, didn’t notice the people around you, because your eyes are crap now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have your drinks, and decide to go home, feeling unwell, walking around the area without a destination. Well you have to be careful with that because you might get just labelled as a stalker for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my point is I love working, but our shop is located in another shop, so we can’t open yet, but someone from our company found a video, where a man was making latte art by pouring the milk out of a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the challange to do the same, I am at home so I don’t have any special equipment, and I made a deal: if I can make it, I can have a pop up coffee stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, but I need video evidence of it. Absolutely no problem. I just got a new hobby in the past 5 months which is video editing. My recording skills are not good, but I am working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I made a nice broll of the processs making coffee at home, but the hard part when I have to record myself making latte art. There is nobody to hold the camera, so I taped an action camera to my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it didn’t work out, so I asked my friend to help me record the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His answer was: -”We gonna find a date for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just standing thinking, that could be an interesting date filming me making coffee. I might just make and advert for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“ &lt;strong&gt;!Looking for a date!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;preferably women, age between 18 –99 (&lt;em&gt;even lego didn’t recommended over 99&lt;/em&gt;) 
Camera skills are not mandatory, but massive extra points if you have it. 
Please send an e-mail with your CV to the link.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully it is looks like we will reopen soon, so I no longer need the video, but I am not sure if should I inform my frined or not, he is so excited to find me a date…
… I am a bit worried, I might have to make a movie, that is gonna be the new star wars. I am not saving on effects, I am saving on camera crew.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I thought for my first post I will start with a new very recent story.
