title: "Stalking and dates"

---

I thought for my first post I will start with a new very recent story. I am working in a coffee shop, I love it, but there is covid-19 so we were just chilling at home for the past 5 months. I’m a person who loves working, I can’t really understand people to be honest, that is why I love working that won’t change. Sometimes I try to have friends, but I always end up with awkward situations.

For example, if someone knows you, and you might have depression and just got bad news. You might end up drinking in a bar, just to get over it, didn’t notice the people around you, because your eyes are crap now.

So you have your drinks, and decide to go home, feeling unwell, walking around the area without a destination. Well you have to be careful with that because you might get just labelled as a stalker for a lifetime.

Anyway, my point is I love working, but our shop is located in another shop, so we can’t open yet, but someone from our company found a video, where a man was making latte art by pouring the milk out of a bottle.

We got the challange to do the same, I am at home so I don’t have any special equipment, and I made a deal: if I can make it, I can have a pop up coffee stand.

Great, but I need video evidence of it. Absolutely no problem. I just got a new hobby in the past 5 months which is video editing. My recording skills are not good, but I am working on it.

So I made a nice broll of the processs making coffee at home, but the hard part when I have to record myself making latte art. There is nobody to hold the camera, so I taped an action camera to my head.

Well it didn’t work out, so I asked my friend to help me record the video.

His answer was: -”We gonna find a date for you.”

I was just standing thinking, that could be an interesting date filming me making coffee. I might just make and advert for it:

> “ **!Looking for a date!** 
>
> preferably women, age between 18 –99 (*even lego didn’t recommended over 99*) 
> Camera skills are not mandatory, but massive extra points if you have it. 
> Please send an e-mail with your CV to the link.”

		
Thankfully it is looks like we will reopen soon, so I no longer need the video, but I am not sure if should I inform my frined or not, he is so excited to find me a date...
… I am a bit worried, I might have to make a movie, that is gonna be the new star wars. I am not saving on effects, I am saving on camera crew.
